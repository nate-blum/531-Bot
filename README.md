Hello! Thank you for taking the time to look at my side projects!\
This is a simple web server I made for helping me plan my workouts.

#### 5/3/1:

Powerlifting is an up-and-coming weightlifting sport in which the goal is to achieve
the highest possible "total", which is simply the sum of your best successful attempts
in the three lifts which comprise the sport, namely the bench press, deadlift, and squat.
So if I were to bench press 275lbs, deadlift 415lbs, and squat 365lbs, my total would be 1055lbs.
5/3/1 is a popular powerlifting training program which takes in your current 1 rep max (the heaviest weight you
could possibly complete a single repetition of a given exercise with) in a particular exercise,
and prescribes particular set/rep schemes and weights in order to get stronger. Because it is
based on percentages and math, I was able to make a program to calculate the workouts for me
and send them to a homescreen widget I made on my phone. I also had buttons for going to
the next workout, and increasing/decreasing the weight based on how I felt that day. I
also stored all the workouts in a MongoDB database so that I would be able to see my progress
over time.
